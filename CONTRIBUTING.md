## Code of Conduct

Please adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to maintain a welcoming and inclusive community. Be respectful and constructive in your interactions.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Setting Up the Environment

- Ensure you have PHP 8+ installed.
- Install dependencies using Composer:

  ```bash
  composer install
  ```

- Use the interactive installer to set up the project by visiting `http://yourdomain.com/installer.php`.

### 2. Directory Structure

The framework follows the MVC architecture. Key directories include:

- `app/`: Contains models, views, and controllers.
- `core/`: Houses essential libraries such as `db.php`, `request.php`, and `response.php`.
- `static/`: Static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- `config/`: Configuration files.

Review the README for more details on the project's structure.

## Pull Request Guidelines

To ensure a smooth review process:

- **Branch Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names such as `fix/issue-name` or `feature/feature-name`.
- **Write Descriptive Commit Messages**: Clearly explain the purpose of your changes.
- **Keep Changes Focused**: Avoid bundling unrelated changes in a single pull request.
- **Add Tests**: Include tests for new features or bug fixes.
- **Link Issues**: If your pull request addresses an issue, reference it in the description (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
